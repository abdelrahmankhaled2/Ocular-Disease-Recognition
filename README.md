# Ocular-Disease-Recognition

Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) is a structured ophthalmic database of 5,000 patients with the following information:

- Age
- Color fundus photographs from the left and right eyes
- Doctors' diagnostic keywords from doctors

This dataset represents a "real-life" set of patient information collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from different hospitals/medical centers in China. The fundus images were captured using various cameras in the market, such as Canon, Zeiss, and Kowa, resulting in varied image resolutions.

Annotations in the dataset were labeled by trained human readers with quality control management. Patients are classified into eight labels, including:

- Normal (N)
- Diabetes (D)
- Glaucoma (G)
- Cataract (C)
- Age-related Macular Degeneration (A)
- Hypertension (H)
- Pathological Myopia (M)
